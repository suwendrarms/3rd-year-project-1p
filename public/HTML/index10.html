    Office is described as the nerve centre of the entire organization. The present day office activities have expanded to a wider extent to keep pace with rapid globalization.Further, office by itself has become an indispensable part of any business organization.Modern offices are organized on scientific principles and their techno-savvy office managers which has paved way for the sustenance of a business amidst cutthroat
    competition. Each office has a personality of its own. This personality is a reflection of the purpose for which an office exists. The manufacturing office will have a profile that differs from that of a sales office. The accounting office will have a different orientation from that of a research and development office.
