Our Resignation policy presents guidelines for handling resignations at our company. Voluntary separations happen occasionally, and we want to ensure that our company appropriately handles them and maintains a smoothly-running workplace.<br>
<u>Scope</u><br><br>
This policy applies to all of our employees. A “resignation” occurs when an employee voluntarily informs HR or their manager that they will stop working for our company.<br><br>

<u>Policy elements</u><br><br>
Notice of resignation<br>
Revoking resignation<br>
Communicating a resignation<br>
Forced Resignation<br>
