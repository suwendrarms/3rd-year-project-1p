A confidentiality policy should also describe the level of privacy employees can expect relating to their own personal property (e.g., “for your own protection, do not leave valuable personal property at work and do not leave personal items — especially your purse, briefcase or wallet — unattended while you are at work.<br><br>

<u>Policy brief & purpose</u><br>
We designed our company confidentiality policy to explain how we expect our employees to treat confidential information. Employees will unavoidably receive and handle personal and private information about clients, partners and our company. We want to make sure that this information is well-protected.<br>
We must protect this information for two reasons. It may:<br><br>

Be legally binding (e.g. sensitive customer data.)<br>
Constitute the backbone of our business, giving us a competitive advantage (e.g. business processes.)<br>
