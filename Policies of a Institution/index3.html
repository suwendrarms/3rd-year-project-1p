The probationary period definition for new employees is the time between signing an employment contract and being granted permanent employment status. ... At the end of the probation period (or possibly before that), the supervisor will determine if the employee should be retained in the organization.A probationary period varies widely depending on the business, but can last anywhere from 30 days to several years. In cases of several years, probationary levels may change as time goes on. If the new employee shows promise and does well during the probationary time, they are usually removed from probationary status, and may be given a raise or promotion as well (in addition to other privileges, as defined by the business). Probation is usually defined in a company's employee handbook, which is given to workers when they first begin a job.
