Before we talk about Office Timing policy and analyze components of a work hours policy sample let us have consider different types of employment contracts, because they often define working time schedule.<br><br>
<u>Types of contracts</u><br>

<b>Full-time contracts</b> are the legacy contracts for permanent workers. These days they are still the most common types of contracts, even though  other types of agreements are on the rise. In the majority of cases full-time contracts presuppose a work schedule of 40+ hours per week, parental leave allowances, vacation entitlement, pension benefits and sick leaves<br><br>

<b>Part-time contracts</b> mean that under this category of a work agreement an employee also holds a permanent position at an organization, but works less hours. The number of working hours is set in a contract.<br><br>

<b>Fixed-term contractors</b> are sometimes hired to complete a certain project or for a certain amount of time. However, a fixed-term contract sometimes presupposes long-term cooperation. Depending on a length of such contracts employees may or may not be entitled to a vacation break.<br><br>

<b>Temporary contracts</b> presuppose that you hire an employee on as-needed bases and state when the contract will end. Just like in case with fixed-term contractors staff members working under temporary contracts are not included in your payroll.<br><br>
