Corporate social responsibility studies prove that an employee is increasingly a key stakeholder for companies. Firms are starting to think about their workforce as a real opportunity to manage and improve their human and economic capital. Employee welfare and benefit schemes are particularly important in this perspective and top companies are investing significantly in this direction. On the basis of an empirical cross-analysis, conducted on a questionnaire addressed to its own employees, by one of the world's biggest multinational groups, and in which the level of satisfaction of benefits and welfare schemes is investigated, significant results emerged: the utility of benefits is marginally higher in women than in men; an evident direct linear relationship exists between job standing and benefit satisfaction, with the exception of factory workers; seniority and age variance of employees do not imply different marginal utility in benefits. Furthermore, the implementation of some limited cost benefits would generate higher marginal utility in employees than of other, more expensive and exclusive, benefits.
